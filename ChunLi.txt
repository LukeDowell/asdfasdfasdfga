Chun-Li


normies
--------------
s.lp 4f long as fuck
c.lp 4f stubby, cancels into spinning bird kick

s.lk 5f long range, buffer into drive rush for big dam
c.lk 4f nice low check

st.mp 5f +1 on block
c.mp 6f links from a CH light punch, and from a st.mp, mostly combo filler
b or f.mp 7f thic poke, wide cancel window, main tool
j.mp good air-to-air, can go into air legs 

st.mk 7f anti air, special cancellable
c.mk 7f, low, big range, special cancellable, can buffer into DR
j.mk crossup jump attack, on hit combos into s.mp
jd.mk air stomp, used all the time in combos, and for sneaky jump ins to cancel into legs
 
s.hp 13f, high risk high reward, not as good as it was before, great punish counter
specials
c.hp 11f, huge cancel window, -2 on block, long active frames 
b.hp 8f, great counter poke, useful meaty tool, good damage, natural qcf hk combo
qf.hp 21f overhead, -2 on block, can be cancelled into stance
j.hp far range forward 


s.hk 14f giga dam anti air, high damage combo route, bad neutral tool
c.hk 9f -7 on block, can't be swept in return, moves you forward
f.hk 16f airborne, beats throws and crouch, big dam, extreme recovery on whiff
df.hk crossup gimmick, can be parried 

specials
--------------
kikoken - good fireball, slow enough to let you DR behind it, unsafe beware at wall
lighting legs - light leaves you +3 in range, medium is a reliable combo filler, heavy knockdown leads to good oki
spinning bird kick - sbk - can get light from lights, medium from mediums, and heavy from heavies. great setup tool, drive is combo tool
upkicks - dd k - unfortunate input, main anti air,

other stuff
--------------

NEUTRAL
f.hp, c.mk, s.hk are all good moves to buffer into stance
lp is the only stance move that is a true blockstring in most cases
kikokens are unsafe at the wall, except for OD
kikoken can be a useful meaty tool at the corner, can charge during sbk and other enders
after SBK you should be able to dash or walk up and do a strike throw mixup but it's tight and manually timed


MEATIES
you can walk up after medium and light spinning bird kicks and do a strike / throw mixup
mk sbk, DI whiff s.lp, b.hp will catch everything except for a reversal
mk sbk, DI df.hp will hit both recovery options
hk sbk, hk hazanshu will hit meaty
d.hk, d.mp (whiff), b.hp (+9 / +3)
d.hk, dash, s.lp (whiff), b.hp 

SAFE JUMPS
(corner) OD sbk, mk legs, jump and delay jd.mk into j.hk. Make sure you are ready for blocking the reversal after jd.mk
(corner) OD sbk, instant jd.mk, jd.mk, j.hp > hp into j.hk


INTERACTIONS
some SA2 enders:
 - delay j.mp, land and jump immediately, d.mk, j.mp, mk legs (style)
 - j.mp, delay 2nd j.mp, immediate j.hp, j.hp (a little finicky but doable, combos into super in corner)
 - j.mp, hk sbk (good dam, corner carry, the j.mp should hit right after the peak of chun's jump arc, start charging immediately after jump cancelling)
