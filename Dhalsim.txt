from instant air teleport or IATP (up and immediately yoga teleport)

j.lp is +1 on block, 9-8f on hit, whiffs crouchers
j.lk is +3 on block, 6f on hit, hits crouchers


specials
--------------
Yoga Fire: qcf p, can hold to add a hit to the fireball and mix up timing. OD instantly gives held fireball
Yoga Arch: qcf k, excellent for covering the air and allowing teleport approaches. Strength determines how far the arch goes. OD will bounce and follow opponent, even behind them
Yoga Flame: hcb p, OD throws opponent in the air, good for breaking DI, using as a meaty, and combo ender 
Yoga Blast: hcb k, knocks down, combo ender, short range
Yoga Comet: jump hcb p, excellent zoning tool, OD allows followups after, like teleports or normals
Yoga Float: jump d+kk, classic dhalsim floaty boi tool. Too many uses to list here
Yoga Teleport: forward or back ppp or kkk, ppp goes behind them, kkk goes in front, forward teleports to opponent, back teleports away. Some invincibility frames, but unsafe to just raw teleport without fireball cover
